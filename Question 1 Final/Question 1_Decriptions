Code::Blocks framework, Project, Set Program's arguments, the file name with its format (Input_FIle.txt) is written. The output of the program is saved in the Result.txt file.

The description commnets for diffrent parts of the program are included in the source code.

Verification Example:

Two examples are solved using this program, and the results (text files) are demonstrated in the related folders. The palindrome words included in the input files are:
Refer, level,Civic.
