Program Objectives:

In this C program, first, a special function is defined (getSpecialProducts) in which for a given vector of integers, the product of every integer except for the integer at 
that index is computed. Then, this function is used and called in a master program, and the results are written in a text file. 

Code Structure:

The input integers are read from a text file(created by user) and are saved in an array(arr_in[]). The function main() accepts the name of this text file as its first argument.
The defined function (getSpecialProducts) takes the array arr_in[] as its argument and calculates the speacial product. The function, then, prints the outputs in
a text file (Results.txt). It should be noted that the name of the input file (Input_File.txt) is introduced into the C peogram following these setting :
Code::Blocks: Project>Set Program's arguments>file name with txt format (Input_File.txt).

The description commnets for diffrent parts of the program are included in the source code.

Verification Example:

Two examples are solved using this program, and the results (text files) are demonstrated in the related folders.
